This [Framer component](https://framer.com/) allows you to seamlessly integrate a Buttondown subscription form into your Framer site.

Credit to [@mergesort](https://github.com/mergesort) for both the initial implementation and allowing us to publish this component under the Buttondown umbrella! You can read more about the component [here](https://build.ms/2024/10/13/building-a-customizable-framer-component/).
